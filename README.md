# AirQualityIndex
test assignment

Just a simple app that shows a list of AQI stations from https://aqicn.org/json-api/doc/

User can select the radius to load stations within and set the min index quality value.

After click on station item, some more stations-specific info is supposed to load from api. But not yet :)
